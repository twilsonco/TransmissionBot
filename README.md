# Transmission Discord Bot
A self-hosted python [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot for controlling an instance of [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com), the bittorrent client,  from a **private** Discord server.
Using the [transmissionrpc](https://pythonhosted.org/transmissionrpc/) python library, this bot is built on [kkrypt0nn's bot template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template) and adapted from [leighmacdonald's transmission scripts](https://github.com/leighmacdonald/transmission_scripts).

## Features overview
* [Interact via text channels or DMs](#channelDM)
* [Add transfers](#add)
* [Modify existing transfers](#modify)
* [Check transfer status](#status) (with optional realtime updating of output)
* [Notification system for transfer state changes](#notifications)
* [Pretty output and highly configurable](#pretty)
* [Easy setup](#setup)

## Example images
* Various images of TransmissionBot interaction through DM (light mode images) and in-channel (dark mode images)
* Going left to right, top to bottom for light mode images
	* Adding new transfers from torrent file (can also add magnet links or a url to a torrent file)
	* Listing transfers (with filtering, sorting, regex searching by name and tracker, etc.)
	* Modifying transfers
		* All transfers for pause/resume

## Install
1. Get [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com) and setup its [web interface](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/using-the-transmission-web-interface/)
2. Install python 3, [transmissionrpc](https://pypi.org/project/transmissionrpc/), pytz, and [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
3. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/twilsonco/TransmissionBot`

## Configure
1. Setup your new bot on Discord:
	1. Sign up for a Discord [developer account](https://discord.com/developers/docs)
	2. Go to the [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications), click *New Application*, pick a name and click *Create*
		* *Note the `CLIENT ID`*
	3. Click on *Bot* under *SETTINGS* and then click *Add Bot*
	4. Fill out information for the bot and **uncheck the `PUBLIC BOT` toggle**
		* *Note the bot `TOKEN`*
2. Invite the bot to your server
	1. Go to `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<client_id>&scope=bot&permissions=<permissions>`
		* replace `<client_id>` with the `CLIENT ID` from above
		* replace `<permissions>` with the minimum permissions `93248`(*for read/send/manage messages, embed links, read message history, and add rections*) or administrator permissions `9` to keep things simple
	2. Invite the bot to your server
2. Configure `bot.py`
	1. Set values in the `CONFIG` variable, which are described inline
		* Values that MUST be configured: `bot_token`, `listen_channel_ids` if you want to use in-channel, `notification_channel_id` if you wish to use in-channel notifications, `owner_user_ids` at least with your Discord user id, `tsclient` with information pointing to your Transmission remote gui, `whitelist_user_ids` at least with your Discord user id and any other Discord users you wish to be able to use the bot.
		* After first run, a `config.json` file will be created in the same directory as `bot.py`. This file should then be used to make any configuration changes, and the definition of `CONFIG` in `bot.py` should be commented out or removed.
	2. Configure logging
		* Pick a location for the logfile on line 124; default is the same directory where bot.py resides
		* Optionally disable logging by setting the log level to `logging.CRITICAL` which isn't used anywhere
3. Run with `python3 /path/to/TransmissionBot/bot.py` and enjoy!

## Detailed features

### <a name="channelDM">Interact via text channels or DMs</a>
* Use commands with `t/` prefix in text channel or via DM
* Via DM only, use commands without prefix (*e.g.* `summary` or `s` rather than `t/summary` or `t/s`)
* *Why use DMs vs in-channel?*
	* Use DMs for user privacy or to keep the in-channel usage clean
	* Use in-channel when privacy isn't an issue, or if you wish to take advantage of auto-updating output
	* *Note: you can configure the bot to only respond to DMs or in-channel commands, so it can be a fully DM-based method of controlling Transmission if you wish*

### <a name="add">Add transfers</a>
* Simply drag a `.torrent` file into the channel on discord and it will be added and started
* Alternatively, enter a transfer magnet link or an address to a `.torrent` file using `t/add MAGNET_OR_URL`

### <a name="modify">Modify existing transfers</a>
* `t/modify` to pause, resume, verify, remove, or remove and delete one or more transfers

* `t/help modify` for more info

### <a name="status">Check transfer status</a>

#### List one or more transfers with pertinent information
* `t/list`

### <a name="help">`t/help` for usage information</a>
* Print help for some commands using `t/help COMMAND_NAME` (*e.g.* `t/help list`)

### <a name="setup">Easy setup</a>
0. Setup bot on Discord developer portal
1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/twilsonco/TransmissionBot`
2. Configure `CONFIG` in `bot.py` to your liking
3. Run bot `python3 /path/to/bot.py`
	* Bot will create `config.json`, after which you can remove or comment the definition of `CONFIG` in `bot.py` to make future updates easier

## To-do (~~implemented~~)
* Comment and clean up code so people can read/trust it
* Command to print detailed information for transfer(s)
	* Complete connection information
	* Lists of transfer files, peers, trackers
* ~~Add ability to verify transfer data~~
* When searching by name, update regex to include potential accented characters, eg `pokemon` would also match `pokémon`
* ~~Specify number of transfers to show when using `list` or `modify`~~
* Combine the `list` and `modify` commands in the code, with a simple parameter to specify whether or not modification is allowed
* Currently, searching by name is done with case-insensitive regex. Update to that if a user includes upper case characters, case-sensitive search is performed
* ~~Add recurring list option. Ie every five seconds replace `list` output with fresh output. This would be done by reacting to a "repeat" emoji to initiate repetition of the current search~~ (also did this for `summary`)
* ~~Add additional filtering options: stalled, error, non-zero up/down rate.~~
* Add shorthand for filtering options (downloading/seeding/stalled/paused become d/s/i/p etc., that's i for "idle" since s is for seeding)
* Add a `top` command that'sessentially a combination of the up/down rate filter and the repeating output features 
* Ability to refine `list` output with filter or sort using reactions; ie click a filter or sort reaction which triggers another message with additional reactions to click to apply the extra filters or sort
* Ability to specify which files to include in download (we'll see about that; sounds clunky but maybe using file ID specifiers *e.g.* `1,3-5,8`)
* ~~Notifications for when a transfer finishes/stalls/errors~~
	* ~~via DM to the user that added the transfer~~
	* ~~or by posting to the channel from which a transfer was added~~
	* ~~Let other users opt to receive notifications for transfers they *didn't* add~~
* Post-download file management (*never going to happen...*)
	* Compress files (encrypted) and make available for direct download from server via download link posted to channel or DM'd to user
* ~~Use JSON config file so that updating is non-destructive~~
* Add `set` command so owners can edit configuration through Discord
* ~~Add a toggle for minimalised output for better display on mobile devices. Toggle using `t/compact` as standalone command or by clicking a 📱 reaction. Store as global variable so all commands output can be affected.~~
